Popovers
========

iOS Project demonstrating how to use Popovers on iPad

This demo shows two approaches in two branches: 

* creating a Popover in Code (Code branch)
* and creating a Popover in your Storyboard (Storyboard branch)

The master branch doesn't really do anything other than hold this readme file.
